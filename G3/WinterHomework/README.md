##  Number to Words

Create a web page that can convert a number entered in an input in digits to the same number in words. The result should be printed on the page. The converter should convert to at least a trillion. 

```sh
Input: 0		Result: zero
Input: 13		Result: thirteen 	
Input: 345		Result: three hundred forty-five
Input: 20056	    Result: twenty thousand fifty-six
```

## Standard Calculator

Create a web calculator with all the standard features. The calculator should have buttons for the numbers to click (just like calculators in real life, no inputs!). It should have buttons for the operations: Sum, Subtract, Multiply and Divide. It should also have the standard buttons equals, decimal dot and reset ( C ). There should be a display where we can see the numbers that we are entering and results (like calculators in real life). The calculator should show error message if number is too large or if we are dividing by zero.

 * Note: The eval() function is not allowed!
