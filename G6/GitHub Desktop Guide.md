# Beginner Guide for GitHub Desktop

> Before you start reading the documentation, please make sure to create Git Hub account and install GitHub desktop application - https://desktop.github.com/


## Welcome to GitHub

Welcome to GitHub where millions of developers share and work together on software. Ready to get started? Let’s learn the basics how this all works by building and publishing your first Github Repository! If you still do not have GitHub account, please sign up here - [GitHub Sign Up](https://github.com/join)

## Create Repository

Right now, we’re in your first GitHub **repository**. A repository is like a folder or storage space for your project. Your project's repository contains all its files such as code, documentation, images, and more.

## Download and Install GitHub Desktop

#### [Download GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)

After the installation locate the application in your machine and open it, you should get this window:

## Clone your Repository to your Device

Once you are done with the authentication, you need to clone your repository to your machine. Cloning the repository will give you the ability to synchronize your code in a easy way on your github storage.

**First Step**

## Practice: Use GitHub Desktop and an editor to make a change from your computer

### Using an editor to make changes

Let’s make a change to your GitHub file. From GitHub Desktop, click the “Open in…” button in the middle of the screen to “open the repository in your external editor” that you just downloaded. Or just open the folder/file with VS Code and make some changes to your file.

![Open-in-editor](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/721500/63188833-82fb9600-c030-11e9-8777-a67c1713d59f.png)

In the left sidebar, click the `index.html` file to open it, and go ahead and add another line. Maybe, “Building websites is fun! You should try it too!” or whatever you want to add.

Now switch back to GitHub Desktop, and you should see the change you made.

### Commit your changes

Now you can commit your changes by typing a message in the `Summary` box at the bottom left, and then click the blue `Commit` button below that.

### Push your changes to GitHub.com

Now let’s push your commit to GitHub.com as well so it’s saved there and you can publish it to your site. Click the “Push origin” button to push your commit to GitHub.com. 

![Push-to-GitHub](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/721500/63188834-82fb9600-c030-11e9-9d8e-6c6ed6d48504.png)

Now click the “View on GitHub” button to get back to your repository’s page on GitHub.com.

### Deploy and see your changes on your Github repository link.

Once you commit your changes, they are automatically published on your GitHub. Refresh your browser to see it.
