# JS Libraries ðŸ™Œ

## Adding a JS library to your page

JavaScript libraries are ready-to-use packages of already prepared code, that bring some functionality to your page. These libraries can be downloaded and referenced to, or be imported via a link, through some content delivery network ( CDN ). There are a few things that are important to know about using libraries:

* Downloaded libraries work even if you are offline, libraries added through a CDN require an internet connection
* Libraries sometimes have a dependency on other libraries so you must add them all to work
* The order of libraries and scripts, in general, is very important
  * Scripts are executed one by one in the order in which they are added to the HTML file
  * Your script with your custom javascript needs to be AFTER the library script, to use the features. ( if it is before, it will not be able to use the features because they don't exist yet )
  * Libraries that depend on other libraries need to be after the dependent libraries that they need
* Libraries have documentation that will help you set it up, lists functionality, and help you use it
* There are more advanced ways of adding libraries in a project as well, called package managers
